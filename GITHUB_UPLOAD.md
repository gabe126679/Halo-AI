## 🚀 Step-by-Step GitHub Upload

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: **`Halo-AI`**
3. Description: "AI-powered CRM + voice/SMS automation platform for service businesses"
4. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect and Push Your Code
After creating the empty repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Halo-AI.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop
If you prefer a GUI:
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Add existing repository → Choose the project folder
3. Publish repository → Name it "Halo-AI"
4. Push to GitHub

## 📝 Commands to Copy

Run these in your terminal from the project folder:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\gabem\Desktop\Anni AI\sample website\project"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Halo-AI.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push everything to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 If You Get Authentication Errors

### Option 1: Use Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with "repo" scope
3. Use token as password when prompted

### Option 2: Use SSH
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Halo-AI.git

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```
